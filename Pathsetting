PATH is an environmental variable in Linux and other Unix-like operating
systems that tells the shell which directories to search for executable
files (i.e., ready-to-run programs) in response to commands issued by a
user. It increases both the convenience and the safety of such operating
systems and is widely considered to be the single most important
environmental variable.
Environmental variables are a class of variables (i.e., items whose values
can be changed) that tell the shell how to behave as the user works at the
command line (i.e., in a text-only mode) or with shell scripts (i.e., short
programs written in a shell programming language). A shell is a program
that provides the traditional, text-only user interface for Unix-like
operating systems; its primary function is to read commands that are typed
in at the command line and then execute (i.e., run) them. 

Practical - Setting Path
Login as root
$id
$echo $PATH
$useradd john
$passwd john
$su - john
$id
Verify john's PATH
$echo $PATH
you cant find :/sbin:/usr/sbin so u cant run cmnd's fdisk, shred under
the same.
$fdisk -l
will get command not found.
So u can set path, but it's temporary for the shell.
$PATH=$PATH=:/sbin:/usr/sbin
To set under environment run
$export PATH
For permanent
you can locate the above two cmnds under /etc/profile file, which
run's always after login.
Now checkk you will get the above added dir under john’s path. 

$echo $PATH
Now try
$ fdisk -l
Note-: The cmd is executed but fdisk binary will work only by uid 0
(root), bcoz it's programmed like that.
So search for the cmd in /sbin & /usr/sbin , which can run by other
uid's.
Now create a testscript under /opt and execute the script
$vi /opt/testscript
#Append the following
 echo “ THIS IS MY SCRIPT”
#Save
$cd /opt
set execute permisson
$chmod +x /opt/testscript
$./testscript # (./ means current path execution)
But what if u want to run the script from any other directories under
your filesystem hiriearchy.
Then set the /opt dir to the users path as mentioned above or copy
the script under the following PATH . (which is already set)
set. For eg-:
$PATH=$PATH:/opt
$cd /
$testscript
or
$cp /opt/testscript /bin or /usr/local/bin etc...
Now try running the script
$cd /
$testscript
